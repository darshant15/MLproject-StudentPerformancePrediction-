## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict **student academic performance** based on socio-demographic, family, and educational background factors.  
By leveraging **machine learning regression models**, the project provides insights into the most influential factors affecting academic success.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To build an **end-to-end ML pipeline** for predicting student performance.  
- To perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and understand key patterns in student behavior.  
- To apply and compare different **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- To evaluate models with metrics such as **R², MSE, and RMSE**.  
- To identify **significant predictors** such as parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.  
- (Optional) To deploy the best-performing model using **Flask/Streamlit** for real-world usage.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Academic institutions often struggle to identify students at risk of underperforming.  
Traditional evaluation methods may fail to capture underlying socio-demographic and psychological factors that impact student performance.  

**This project addresses the challenge by:**
- Using data-driven insights to predict performance.  
- Helping educators and policymakers design **targeted interventions**.  
- Providing a reusable ML pipeline for continuous improvement.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- ✅ Create a structured ML pipeline: ingestion → preprocessing → training → evaluation.  
- ✅ Conduct **feature engineering** to boost model accuracy.  
- ✅ Implement multiple ML models and **benchmark performance**.  
- ⬜ Extend the project to **real-time deployment** (Flask/Streamlit app).  
- ⬜ Integrate **MLOps tools** like MLflow for experiment tracking.  

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

- A trained ML model that can **accurately predict student scores** based on multiple factors.  
- Insights into which variables (like **parental education, test preparation, or lunch type**) most strongly influence outcomes.  
- A **scalable pipeline** that can be extended for other datasets or academic performance studies.  
- A potential deployment-ready API/app for educators and students.
