##  Project Overview

A machine learning pipeline to predict student academic performance from socio-demographic and academic factors. This project includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and optional deployment.

---

##  Key Features & Architecture

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Load student performance datasets (e.g., UCI data) and execute EDA, feature engineering, and cleaning.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), tune hyperparameters, and evaluate using metrics such as RÂ² and MSE.
- **Model Deployment (Optional)**: Deploy the trained model using Flask or Streamlit API (if implemented) for user-friendly predictions.
- **Version Control**: Full code, scripts, and notebooks are tracked in GitHub for reproducibility and collaboration.

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, other ML libraries.
- Machine Learning: Regression techniques, hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
- Deployment: Flask or Streamlit (if included).
- Development Workflow: Jupyter Notebooks, modular scripts.
- Version Control: GitHub repository.

##  How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darshant15/MLproject-StudentPerformancePrediction-.git
   cd MLproject-StudentPerformancePrediction-
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run EDA and modeling**

   * Execute notebooks in `notebooks/` for data exploration and initial modeling.
   * Run the scripts under `src/` for ingestion, cleaning, and training:

     ```bash
     python src/data_ingestion.py
     python src/data_preprocessing.py
     python src/model_trainer.py
     ```

4. **Deploy (if applicable)**
   If youâ€™ve added a Flask or Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   python src/predict_api.py
   ```

## Example Insights (Optional)

* Parental education and test preparation significantly influence student outcomes.
* Feature engineering boosts model accuracy across regression algorithms.
* Hyperparameter tuning identifies the optimal model for real-world need.

## Roadmap & Enhancements

* âœ… Core ML pipeline (EDA â†’ training â†’ evaluation)
* â¬œ Add model deployment UI (Flask or Streamlit)
* â¬œ Include hyperparameter tracking (e.g., MLflow or DVC)
* â¬œ Containerize with Docker for consistency and portability
